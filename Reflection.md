# ✍️ Project Reflection

For this project, I developed a weather dashboard using Python, ipywidgets and the OpenWeatherMap API.
The Weather Dashboard allows user to input a personal API Key, select a city from Mauritius and display current weather conditions in a visually appealing format.
The project was developed with AI tools, primarily ChatGpt that acted as a coding assistant and design advisor.
I used AI to enhance function robustness, implement clean UI elements, and apply meaningful error handling.
It has also helped me as a real time assistant to debug.
For example, the get_weather() function was improved to raise exceptions on failed requests and return a structured dictionary with key weather attributes. 
With targeted prompts like “Make this function more robust” or “Help me style weather cards in ipywidgets,” I guided the AI toward producing more effective and reusable code.
Prompting strategies such as before and after example prompting were especially effective. By providing both the original code and a goal, 
the AI was able to focus its responses and offer concrete improvements. Styling sdvice, such as using gradients and hover effects added a modern and responsive feel to the dashboard. 
What worked well was the interactive layout using widgets, vbox, styled HTML cards and graceful error messaging. 
In the future, i would like to break down the UI elements even more, and maybe add some charts or forecast data.
Additionally, by putting voice or natural language queries would enhnance interactivity of the weather dashboard.
Overall. this project has shown me how AI tools can speed up development and help understand both fronted and backend design.
Personally, It was a great opportunity to experiment,improve iteratively and create a functional and user- friendly weather dashboard. 
Additionally, this project has taught me that do not treat AI as one-off code generator but as a conversational partner too.This is because by iteratively refining prompts and giving feedback responses, 
I have been able to create a clean and maintainable codebase way quicker. It has also helped me get better at crafting prompts, which will be useful for my future projects with AI.
