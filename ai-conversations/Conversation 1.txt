Me: Can you help me build a weather dashboard using Python and OpenWeatherMap API to show the weather in cities in Mauritius?
AI: Definitely! Let's break it into steps. The dashboard will include:

-A list of Mauritian cities (dropdown)

-Input for API key

-A button to fetch weather

-A visual layout with cards showing temperature, humidity, etc.

We’ll use:

-requests to get weather data

-ipywidgets for interactivity in a Jupyter Notebook

-Some HTML/CSS in widgets for styling

Let’s start with the data-fetching function.
